- Describe the builder and show some screenshots.
- Link to builder which is included in this documentation.

To get started:

1. Go to the `Attack Flow release page
   <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow/releases>`__
   and download ``attack_flow_designer.zip`` as well as ``corpus.zip``.
2. Unzip these two files.
3. In the `attack_flow_designer` directory, double click on `index.html` to open
   it in a web browser.
4. Inside the Attack Flow Designer, go to File → Open Attack Flow. Navigate to
   the `corpus` directory and open one of the `*.afd` files.
5. To create your own Attack Flow, refresh the page. Right-click in the Attack
   Flow workspace to create a node. Drag and drop from the plug icon to connect
   nodes together (subject to the rules of the Attack Flow specification).
6. Save your Attack Flow in one of two formats:
    1. File → Save Attack Flow: saves the file with `*.afd` extension. This file
       is suitable for opening up for editing in the Attack Flow Designer.
    2. File → Publish Attack Flow: saves a `*.json` file that conforms to the
       Attack Flow specification; this file is interoperable with other Attack
       Flow tools.
