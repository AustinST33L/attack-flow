# Attack Flow

The Attack Flow project helps defenders move from tracking adversary behaviors
individually to the sequence of techniques adversaries use to achieve their
goals. Understanding the context within those sequences, as well as the
relationships among them, enables additional defensive capabilities that make
defenders much more effective. The project seeks to demonstrate how attack flows
can explain defensive posture to executives, aid defenders to understand
lessons-learned from an incident, and support red-teamers to easily compose
realistic adversary emulation scenarios.

## Getting Started

Attack Flow is a standard for sharing information about how adversaries use sequences of
multiple techniques to accomplish their objectives. The standard is open source and machine-readable 
(based on STIX 2.1). The 2.0 release will be published on Oct 27th along with a new website
that describes Attack Flow and makes it easy to get started. Until the public launch, you can
find the following resources in this repository:

* Documentation: Download the documentation in HTML or PDF format from [our automated build page](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow-private/actions/runs/3138408426).
* Builder: Download the builder from [our automated build page](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow-private/actions/runs/3138408426).
* Corpus: The example flows in the corpus can be viewed [in this repository](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-flow-private/tree/convert_flows_to_v2/corpus).

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Review the standard, use the designer, and tell us what you think.**  We
  welcome your review and feedback on the data model and our methodology.
- **Help us prioritize additional example flows to create.** Let us know what
  examples you would like to turned into an Attack Flow. Your input will help us
  prioritize how we expand our corpus.
- **Share your use cases.** We are interested in developing additional tools and
  resources to help the community understand and make threat-informed decisions
  in their risk management programs. If you have ideas or suggestions, we
  consider them as we explore additional research projects.
