# Attack Flow

The Attack Flow project helps defenders move from tracking adversary behaviors
individually to the sequence of techniques adversaries use to achieve their
goals. Understanding the context within those sequences, as well as the
relationships among them, enables additional defensive capabilities that make
defenders much more effective. The project seeks to demonstrate how attack flows
can explain defensive posture to executives, aid defenders to understand
lessons-learned from an incident, and support red-teamers to easily compose
realistic adversary emulation scenarios.

## Getting Started

At a high level, Attack Flow is a machine-readable representation of a sequence
of actions and assets along with knowledge properties about those actions and
assets. This representation is composed of five main objects: the *flow* itself,
a list of *actions*, a list of *assets*, a list of knowledge *properties*, and a
list of causal *relationships* between the actions and assets. Each of these
five objects includes a set of *required* and *optional* fields. Attack Flow
uses MITRE ATT&CK to describe specific adversary behaviors.

## Docker

The builder tool can be run as a Docker container. Run `make docker-build` to
build the container image initially, then `make docker-run` to start the
container. Once the image is running, open your browser to http://localhost:8080
to view the builder.

## Getting Involved

There are several ways that you can get involved with this project and help
advance threat-informed defense:

- **Review the standard, use the designer, and tell us what you think.**  We
  welcome your review and feedback on the data model and our methodology.
- **Help us prioritize additional example flows to create.** Let us know what
  examples you would like to turned into an Attack Flow. Your input will help us
  prioritize how we expand our corpus.
- **Share your use cases.** We are interested in developing additional tools and
  resources to help the community understand and make threat-informed decisions
  in their risk management programs. If you have ideas or suggestions, we
  consider them as we explore additional research projects.
